The club isn't the best place to find a lover So the bar is where I go<br/>
 Me and my friends at the table doing shots Drinking fast and then we<br/>
 talk slow Come over and start up a conversation with just me<br/>
 And trust me I'll give it a chance now Take my hand, stop, put<br/> Van
 the Man on the jukebox And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
<br/> Girl, you know I want your love Your love was handmade for<br/> 
somebody like me Come on now, follow my lead I may be crazy, don't mind me<br/>
 Say, boy, let's not talk too much Grab on my waist and put that<br/>
 body on me Come on now, follow<br/> my lead Come, come on now, follow my lead
 I'm in love with the shape of you We push and pull like a magnet do
 <br/>Although my heart is falling too I'm in love with your body
 And last
